# Leaf_Disease_Classification_Using_EfficientNetB3
This repository contains a deep learning project focused on identifying and classifying diseases in plant leaves using the EfficientNetB3 model. The model is trained on an extensive dataset of leaf images representing multiple disease categories to help accurately diagnose plant diseases and support effective crop management.
